Enumeration = information gathering using active (scans) and passive (use of third-party providers) methods

Not OSINT which is exclusively passive method

Our goal is not to get at the systems but to find all the ways to get there.

## Things to wonder

What can we see?&#x20;

What reasons can we have for seeing it?&#x20;

What image does what we see create for us?&#x20;

What do we gain from it?&#x20;

How can we use it?&#x20;

What can we not see?&#x20;

What reasons can there be that we do not see?&#x20;

What image results for us from what we do not see?
