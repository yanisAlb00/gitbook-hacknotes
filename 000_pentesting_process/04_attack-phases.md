## Evasive Testing

Types of Evasive Testing :
- Non-Evasive : the client wants as much information as possible and the most in-depth testing results.
- Evasive : we can add some evasive commands to avoid detection.
- Hybrid-Evasive : the client wants to test specific components and security measures that have been defined in advance.

## Persistence

Once we have an overview of the system, our immediate next step is maintaining access to the exploited host. This way, if the connection is interrupted, we can still access it. 

## Information Gathering and Vulnerability Assessment
Go through the Information Gathering and Vulnerability Assessment stages again

## Pillaging

Pillaging : investigation of internal services and network components

Network configurations :
Interfaces	
Routing
DNS
ARP
Services
VPN
IP 
Subnets	
Shares	
Network Traffic

-> establish persistence
-> password policy
-> hunt for sensitive data

## Privilege escalation

Linux-based systems : root
Windows-based systems : domain administrator/local administrator/SYSTEM

## Data Exfiltration

Test the DLP and EDR of the company.

Possible that the company uses encryption on hard drives to prevent external parties from viewing such information

We can create some fake data and exfiltrate it to our system.

Be careful concerning data type (different regulations).

-> It's a good habit to run a screen recording

# Lateral Movement

1. Pivoting
2. Evasive Testing
3. Information Gathering
4. Vulnerability Assessment : differs from the previous procedures, vulnerabity assessment from inside the network.
5. (Privilege) Exploitation
6. Post-Exploitation

Pivoting or Tunneling : The compromised host will not have the tools to enumerate the internal network. So we use the exploited host as a proxy and perform all the scans from our machine.
