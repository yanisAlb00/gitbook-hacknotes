# POC

Prove that a security problem exists so that the developers or administrators can validate it, reproduce it, see the impact, and test their remediation efforts.

For example : use the calculator "calc.exe" on the target system.

Possible to delivery a script or code that automatically exploits the vulnerabilities found

-> the script is only one way of exploiting a given vulnerability , important to mention and point administrators must work deeper on security aspects.

For example, if a user uses the password Password123, the underlying vulnerability is not the password but the password policy
