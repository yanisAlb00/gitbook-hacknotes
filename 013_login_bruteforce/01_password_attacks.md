# Password Attacks

The HTTP specification provides two parallel authentication mechanisms:

1. Basic HTTP AUTH is used to authenticate the user to the HTTP server.

--> The server's response contains the WWW-Authenticate header field
The client uses the Base64 method for encoding the identifier and password

2. Proxy Server Authentication is used to authenticate the user to an intermediate proxy server.

Password Attack Type :
