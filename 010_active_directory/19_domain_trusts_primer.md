# Domain Trusts Primer

Trust relationship with the new domain : avoid migrating all the established objects

A trust is used to establish forest-forest or domain-domain (intra-domain) authentication.
--> one-way or two-way (bidirectional) communication

- Parent-child: Two or more domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain, meaning that users in the child domain corp.inlanefreight.local could authenticate into the parent domain inlanefreight.local, and vice-versa.
- Cross-link: A trust between child domains to speed up authentication.
- External: A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This type of trust utilizes SID filtering or filters out authentication requests (by SID) not from the trusted domain.
- Tree-root: A two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest.
- Forest: A transitive trust between two forest root domains.
- ESAE: A bastion forest used to manage Active Directory.

Trusts can be transitive or non-transitive :

* A transitive trust means that trust is extended to objects that the child domain trusts. For example, let's say we have three domains. In a transitive relationship, if Domain A has a trust with Domain B, and Domain B has a transitive trust with Domain C, then Domain A will automatically trust Domain C.
Shared, 1 to many	
The trust is shared with anyone in the forest	
Forest, tree-root, parent-child, and cross-link trusts are transitive
* In a non-transitive trust, the child domain itself is the only one trusted.
Direct trust
Not extended to next level child domains
Typical for external or custom trust setups

## Enumeration using Module activedirectory
