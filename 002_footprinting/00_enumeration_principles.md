# Enumeration principles

Enumeration = information gathering using active (scans) and passive (use of third-party providers) methods

Not OSINT which is exclusively passive method

Our goal is not to get at the systems but to find all the ways to get there.


What can we see?
What reasons can we have for seeing it?
What image does what we see create for us?
What do we gain from it?
How can we use it?
What can we not see?
What reasons can there be that we do not see?
What image results for us from what we do not see?
